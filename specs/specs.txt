	foundationPercentage               = 10
	liquidityAndMarketingPercentage    = 10
	gamePercentage                     = 70

	* uint256 totalHolders -> a variables that holds the total number of investors. 
	* mapping (uint256=> address) holders -> a mapping to determine the nth investor
	* mapping (address => uint256)  contributions -> a mapping to determine the contributed amount for an investor

	Example:  Amount contributed by the 3rd investor 
				 address beneficiary = holders[2];
