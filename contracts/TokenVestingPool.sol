/**
 * @title TokenVestingPool
 * @author Wibson Development Team <developers@wibson.org>
 * @notice This contract models a pool of tokens to be distributed among beneficiaries
 * with different lock-up and vesting conditions. There is no need to know the
 * beneficiaries in advance, since the contract allows to add them as time goes by.
 * @dev There is only one method to add a beneficiary. By doing this, not only
 * both modes (lock-up and vesting) can be achieved, but they can also be combined
 * as suitable. Moreover, total funds and distributed tokens are controlled to
 * avoid refills done by transferring tokens through the ERC20.
